                Why did you decide to study software engineering?
            </h2>
        
        <p>
            My desire to pursure software engineering was driven by a combination of things, such as:

            <div class="bullets">
                <ul>   
                   <ol>Notable strength in computer skills</ol>
                   <ol>Career progression</ol>
                   <ol>Career opportunity</ol>
                   <ol>Job security</ol>
                   <ol>But mostly, because i find coding <a id="fun">FUN!!!</a></ol>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <p>Even though i work in the civil construction industry currently, i always found myself spending many hours on basic coding in programs such as Mircosoft Developer creating macros and formulas to assist with making my job quicker, easier and more fun.
            <br><br>
            I am also a very driven individual, and im always looking to upskill myself professionally to ensure i do the best i possibly can at anything i try.
            <br><br>
            Along with that, i also realise that the software industry will continue to rapidly grow for decased to come, which will ensure vast career opportunity.
            <br><br>
            This will ensure i have an abudance of options but will also ensure i can create that point of difference for the current companies i own, which will enable better client interaction and satisfaction.
            <br><br>
            But mostly, i just find coding to be a lot of fun, and something i think i can really succeed at, as i may be a slow learner, but once i learn i generally excel! Imaging being able to work from home, whilst around your family and to love it while youre doing it, its the perfect job!
